# Configure tests in Copilot Studio Accelerator

## Create a new test set

**Test sets** are used to group multiple **tests** together. That way, when running tests, you select a test set, and each test in the test set will be executed as part of the run.

1. Open the Copilot Studio Accelerator application (as seen in [installation instructions](./INSTALLATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md#access-the-copilot-studio-accelerator-app))
2. Navigate to **Test Sets**.
3. Create a **New** Copilot Test Set record.
4. Provide a **Name**.
5. **Save**.

## Create a new test

After you've created a Test Set, you can add Tests to it.
