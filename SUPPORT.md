## Support for the Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit

Although the underlying features and components used to build the Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit are fully supported (such as Power Apps, Power Automate, Dataverse, Copilot Studio endpoints etc.), the accelerator itself represents an example implementation of these features. Our customers, partners, and community can use and customize these features to implement capabilities in their organizations.
