# Copilot Studio Accelerator

The **Copilot Studio Accelerator** is a Power Platform-based solution that helps automate testing of custom copilots created with [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://aka.ms/CopilotStudio).
The main use cases are **intent recognition accuracy** and **AI-generated answers testing**.  

The Copilot Studio Accelerator is a user-friendly application allows testers to configure copilots and tests sets. It has native capabilities such as Excel export or import for bulk creation and updates.

By running individual tests against the Direct Line API, the copilot responses are evaluated against expected results.
To further enrich results, additional data points can be retrieved from Azure Application Insights and from Dataverse, by analyzing Conversation Transcript records (to get the exact triggered topic name, intent recognition scores, etc.).
For AI-generated answers, that are by nature non-deterministic, AI Builder prompts are used to compare the generated answer with a sample answser or with validation instructions.

Today, the tool supports these types of tests:
- Response exact match.
- Attachments match.
- Topic match (requires Dataverse enrichment)
- Generative answsers (requires AI Builder for reponse analysis, and Azure Application Insights for details on why an answer was or was not generated)
